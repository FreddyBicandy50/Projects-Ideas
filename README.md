Goal: is to make an system on arudino's Crystal Liquid Display that can be controlled using a remote controller to manage Different Sensors and Devices example(fan speed, high temperature sensor detector and alerts, LED's Brightness, RFID Scanners)

Learning Outcomes: being able to program for each kind of Sensors and Components to integrate with the system

Extend: we can extend this project by creating a mobile app for all connected components and be able to manage them using the app

goal: this project is a for schools and especially for students and parents it aims to track and monitor students progress like(schedule , Agendas, Attendees, Grades) all of the student information is stored on external mysql database and the sensitive informations and cached data is stored on SQLITE in order to prevent many request on the server

Learning Outcomes: installing android studio and the emulator or using WSL for extra challenge , exchanging data between the app and the mysql database using JDBC Driver , Elegance Design using the basics of Android studio XML forms

Extend: for this project its best to build an API for key user authentications and data transfer and exchange , also since we are doing mobile app its better to use the notification service to get best outcome by this we can send announcements using the app

goal: using scratch is a great and easy way to create little 2d games using a block based programing the aim is to use the platform with everything it got to implement the logic by creating something that can be playable 

Learning Outcomes: applying logic to different sprites , understand the screen axis to control different sprites simoultanosly , apply sounds and costumes , track score 

Extend: we can modify the game to make it work on devices giroscope sensor so dodging the cars will happen by titlting the screen
