# Projects idea for portfolio/university ðŸš€


## Arduino - Controller System (C++) 
Goal: is to make an system on arudino's Crystal Liquid Display that can be controlled using a remote controller to manage Different Sensors and Devices example(fan speed, high temperature sensor detector and alerts, LED's Brightness, RFID Scanners)

Learning Outcomes: being able to program for each kind of Sensors and Components to integrate with the system

Extend: we can extend this project by creating a mobile app for all connected components and be able to manage them using the app
## Android Studio EduLine (Java) <img align="center" width="5%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/117201156-9a724800-adec-11eb-9a9d-3cd0f67da4bc.png"/>
goal: this project is a for schools and especially for students and parents it aims to track and monitor students progress like(schedule , Agendas, Attendees, Grades) all of the student information is stored on external mysql database and the sensitive informations and cached data is stored on SQLITE in order to prevent many request on the server

Learning Outcomes: installing android studio and the emulator or using WSL for extra challenge , exchanging data between the app and the mysql database using JDBC Driver , Elegance Design using the basics of Android studio XML forms

Extend: for this project its best to build an API for key user authentications and data transfer and exchange , also since we are doing mobile app its better to use the notification service to get best outcome by this we can send announcements using the app
